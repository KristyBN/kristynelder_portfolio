### Description<br>
#### Purpose<br>
The purpose of my portfolio piece is to present and showcase my work, skills and experience to future clients and or employers. My portfolio should reflect my personality while showing some of the skills I have learned to this point.<br>

#### Functionality/features<br>
**Home Page**<br>
A major component of the website is the diamond menu bar. This provides the user with access to navigate to the main pages of the website. It includes HTML  to create the navigation. I have also styled with CSS and utilizing SVG to allow me to present the menu at a diamond shape. This allows the menu to be both functional and stylish.
<br><br>
**About Overview Page**<br>
The components that are present on this page is the Navigation menu bar which again allows the user to navigate the website and both visually appealing and also includes a drop down menu within. This menu is also displayed on the "contact" and "blog" pages.<br><br>
The second component is the card feature this presents an image and text with a slight animation for a visually pleasing read of the information about myself and also the languages I have learnt to date. On the languages cards I have also utilized a button which should it be active it would link to my work that I would want to present to future employers.<br><br>
**Contact Page**<br>
On this page I have styled a different type of card that gives access to my contact information and social profiles. Should it be active I would provide links and call to action buttons to send emails or make calls however due to privacy I will not be adding this at the moment. The component uses animation to give a smooth flip style of the card to allow access to the information that the user needs.<br>
<br>
**Blog**<br>
This is again a style of card however includes a category button and also date and author attributes. These blogs would showcase my work and other useful information should it be live by clicking on the blog card it would open up the full blog post.<br><br>
**Some other features**<br>
Some other features in the website include access via the navigation to my resume pdf which will open in a new browser once clicked.<br>
<br>

On the home page there is a nice video playing in the background for visual appeal and engagement.<br><br>
The website is also responsive and mobile friendly, even the diamond menu on the home page will split into four vertical diamonds to continue both visual appeal, ease of reading and functionality.
